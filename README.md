# Final-Project

###### Lucas Barrett, Ronald Baker, Justin Overdorf

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (for Windows)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (for Mac/Linux)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/lucasbarrett1999/Final-Project.git
```


2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```
cd Final-Project
npm install
```

I did not know that you can just run that code and as long as the package.json is correct, it will just install the correct ones for you. Wild


3. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```
